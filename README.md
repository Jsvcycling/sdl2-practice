# SDL2 Practice

This repository is a collection of small programs centered around
SDL2/OpenGL. They are generally cross-platform but they are being developed
entirely on Linux.

This repository isn't meant to be any sort of tutorial or guide. It's just a
collection of little projects I'm writing to learn SDL2 and OpenGL. So take the
code in here with a grain of salt.

## License

I mean, is a license even necessary for this?? Let's throw on MIT License on it
then. Yeah, we'll go with that.
